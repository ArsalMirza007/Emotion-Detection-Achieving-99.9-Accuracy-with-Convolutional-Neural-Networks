# Emotion-Detection-Achieving-99.9-Accuracy-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

# Instructions:
Tasks performed in the provided code:

1. **Load and explore the data**:
   - Load sample images of happy and sad faces from the dataset and display them.

2. **Pre-processing the data**:
   - Use Keras' ImageDataGenerator class to preprocess image data.
   - Instantiate the generator with appropriate parameters such as rescaling and target size.

3. **Defining the callback**:
   - Define a custom callback class (`myCallback`) to stop training when the desired accuracy is reached (99.9%).

4. **Creating and training the model**:
   - Define a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
   - Train the model using the ImageDataGenerator generator, specifying the number of epochs and the custom callback for early stopping.
   - Ensure that the model achieves the desired accuracy of 99.9% before 15 epochs.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Print the number of epochs taken to achieve the desired accuracy.
